## Problem Statememt ‚ùì

**Problem**: Lack of comprehensive data-driven insights hampers effective police performance assessments and resource allocation optimization.  

**Challenge**: Create an analytical dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (response times, crime clearance rates) across different units and locations, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making and resource optimization.

## Overview  ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The Police Performance Analytical Dashboard is a comprehensive tool designed to address the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in performance assessment and resource allocation. It provides actionable insights for strategic decision-making and resource optimization across different supervisory levels within the police department.

Our objective is to develop an analytical dashboard that empowers supervisory officers at every level, from ACP/DSP to Sub Inspector, with actionable insights for strategic decision-making and resource optimization. Our solution offers comprehensive data visualization tools, providing easy interpretation of key performance indicators like response times and crime clearance rates. What sets us apart is our ability to aggregate data at various supervisory levels, offering a holistic view of departmental performance. Real-time updates from multiple sources and automated alerts for non-completion of work items ensure officers always have the latest information and prompt notifications for overdue tasks. Our user-friendly interface streamlines duty allocation and roster management, allowing for better resource allocation based on unique demands. Role-based access control guarantees data security and confidentiality, tailoring access permissions to each supervisory level.
